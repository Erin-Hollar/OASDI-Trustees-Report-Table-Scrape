This R code is used to scrape all tables included the Social Security Administration Trustees Report from years 2014 to 2022. I am currently working on expanding the scrape to earlier years. 
Scraping the tables requires collection of a unique identifying table for each table. These vary across the years. This code consolidates all informaiton needed to scrape the tables into a single data frame, main_table, and scrapes all of the tables into a nested list, raw_data.

It should be noted that this code directly scrapes the tables, regardless of whether the content has changed.
             For example, in 2014, section VI.G (ESTIMATES FOR OASDI AND HI, SEPARATE AND COMBINED), contains 9 tables with G9 representing: OASDI and HI Annual Non-interest Income, Cost, and
             Balance in Current Dollars, Calendar Years 2014-90. From 2015-2022, section VI.G contains 10 tables, 
             with the 9th titled: OASDI and HI Annual Non-interest Income, Cost, and Balance in CPI-Indexed [insert year] Dollars, Calendar Years [insert year]-2100, 
             and the 10th tititled: OASDI and HI Annual Non-interest Income, Cost, and Balance in Current Dollars, Calendar Years [insert year]-2100
             [So in 2014, the 9th is in current dollars and there is no table for CPI-Index dollars. In years 2015-2022, the 9th is CPI-Indexed the 10th is current dollars.]
The nested list contains the tables exactly as they are listed on the OASDI website.
